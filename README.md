## MOVIES CLUB

This project was made to view two sections of movies Top Rated and Recently Released with the `infinite scroll`.  
First screen is login screen. To logged in successfully you can use the below credentials -

},

}`

You can also search for a particular movie and can be able to add movie to your watch list. 
There are two header links present one is to see watch list and other one is logout.

In watch list you can also able to remove movie from your watch list.

## Technology stack

I have used ReactJs Version 16.6.3 with axios(0.18.0), bootstrap 4, react-dom, react-redux, react-router-dom and redux for state management and routing.

## Initial Step

3. Run `npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
